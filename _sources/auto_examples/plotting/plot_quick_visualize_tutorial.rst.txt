==================================
Quickly Visualizing Multiview Data
==================================

Often, before beginning extensive analysis, it is a good idea to visualize
your dataset to help you understand its distribution and design algorithms.
As a simple example, say we had high-dimensional multi-view data that we
wanted to quickly visualize before we begin our analysis. With the
*quick_visualize* function, we can easily do this. As an example, we will
visualize the UCI Multiple Features dataset, which consists of 6
views of varying dimensionality.

Visualize the Multiview Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While a 2D plot will never fully capture the essence of a 6-view dataset,
this simple visualization helps us build intuition about the dataset by
showing us that it can be projected to a nearly-separable subspace.


.. code-block:: default



    # Load 4-class data
    Xs, y = load_UCImultifeature(select_labeled=[0, 1, 2, 3])

    # Visualize the data in 2D, coloring the points by their class label (0-3)
    quick_visualize(Xs, labels=y, title='Labeled Data in 2D', figsize=(5, 5))
