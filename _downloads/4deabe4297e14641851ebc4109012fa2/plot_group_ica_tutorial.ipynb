        "\n# ICA: a tutorial\n\nAuthor: Pierre Ablin\n\nGroup ICA extends the celebrated Independent Component Analysis to multiple datasets.\n\nSingle view ICA decomposes a dataset $X$ as $X = S      imes A^{        op}$, where $S$ are the independent sources (meaning that the columns of $S$ are independent), and $A$ is the mixing matrix.\n\nIn group ICA, we have several views $Xs = [X_1, \\dots, X_n]$. Each view is obtained as\n\n$$\nXi \\simeq S     imes Ai.T\n$$\n\nso the views share the same sources $S$, but have different mixing matrices $A_i$.\nIt is a powerful tool for group inference, as it allows to extract signals that are comon across views.\n"
